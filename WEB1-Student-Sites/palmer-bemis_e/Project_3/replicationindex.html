<div class="gallery"> <p>Skeuomorph comes from the Greek "skeuos", meaning container or tool, and morphÃª, meaning shape.</p>
<p>Most designers these days reject skeuomorphic design though. It often adds unnecessary detail to the UI. This can range from simply making the interface look cluttered or messy to harming usability, such as if text legibility were to be affected.</p>
<p>Neumorphism (sometimes neomorphism) sought to combine flat design with skeuomorphism. It combines simple and clean UI elements with drop shadows and other skeuomorphic elements to create a "fresh" and "modern" style. Web and app designers quickly adopted neumorphism in 2020. Apple also reintroduced many skeuomorphic elements into macOS with the 2020 Big Sur version and iOS 14.</p>
