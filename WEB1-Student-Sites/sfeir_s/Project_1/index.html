<p style="color:navy;" > <i> Stephanie Sfeir is a Lebanese/American graphic designer and
multimedia artist living in Spokane, Washington. Her work explores themes of identity, culture, and
inner monologues using bold typography, collage-like elements, and portraiture. Sfeir has recently
shown her work at Terrain 15, an annual juried multimedia art and music event celebrating artists in
the Spokane area. Sfeir has BA in Graphic Design from Whitworth University.</p> </i>
<h3 style="background-color:lightblue;">ARTIST STATEMENT</h3>
<p>
My work is a celebration of identity and coming of age. Sentimentality runs as deep in me as it does
in the art that I make, taking the form of brightly colored collages, prints, and digital drawings that
explore and commemorate meaningful places, people, and objects in my life. I am heavily inspired
by my personal experiences, including my attachments to nature-loving poets like Mary Oliver,
whose words often transport her audience into mindsets of deep emotion and self-reflection, as
well as artists like Kathleen Ryan that explore life‚Äôs fleeting nature as a symbol. Both women
shamelessly developing their work to embrace their identities and foster narrative conversations
speaks to my goals as a maker. Over the years, I have grown more motivated and encouraged to
explore the romanticism of culture and what it means to know oneself within all contexts. Pulling
inspiration from moments of childhood and pieces from my memories has allowed me to evolve my
work into being more emotionally charged. Many of my pieces showcase the motif of self-
portraiture because of my dedication to getting to know myself through different mediums and
symbolism. Not only does this encourage me to make art for myself as I am in the present, but it
inclines me to make art that speaks to and heals my inner child.
Being able to translate my thoughts and reservations about my life into my handiwork has allowed
me to be in control and appreciate what it means to make things that are meaningful and impactful.
Choosing to work in mediums such as collage, digital or analogue, as well as more recently a focus
on printmaking, has given me the opportunity to be intentional with the materials and what they
may look and feel like. The collection of various materials in my work results in the depiction of a
collection of experiences, feelings, and symbols. For years, the act of creating has served as a form
of expression and decompression. Where I am now, the exploration and implementation, as well as
the interactive nature of the content itself is meant to play a role as a form of escape and
therapy.</p>

This piece is all about challenging the ideas of seasons, life cycles, and the psyche and merging
