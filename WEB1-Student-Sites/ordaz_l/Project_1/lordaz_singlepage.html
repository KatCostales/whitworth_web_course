<p style="text-align:center;">I'm a <strong>graphic design major </strong>here at Whitworth, out of all the schools that I could've gone to I decided on<em> Whitworth</em> because it was the cheapest school out of all my options. This school is close to home and my mom works here so it was the safest option to go for.</p> 
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"> I wanted to go to an art school to study illustration and animation, but since I'm here at Whitworth Graphic Design is the closest to what I wanted to study. I'm hoping that with Graphic Design it will broaden my options in the art world.</p>
