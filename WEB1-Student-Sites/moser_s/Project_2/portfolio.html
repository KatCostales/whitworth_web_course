            <h3> Toca sauce mania</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> I came up with the idea, collected the Taco Bell hotsauce, and put the mosaic together </p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> To bring joy it myself its viwers. To help inspire others.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges Solved:</strong>I had to figure out a way to put all this sauce together. I ended up using E-6000 super glue and canvas.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> I used my design skills along with imagination to create this work of art.</p>
            <p><strong>Process:</strong>I started with being hungry and not wanting to cook, next I decided to drive around until I found a place that looked good. After I arrived at Toco Bell I started playing with my food and thats when I relized the cool littel design I made from the sauce packets. Then I had to find a way to barrow alot of sauce, after collecting my sauce I headed home and got to work making my master piece.</p>
