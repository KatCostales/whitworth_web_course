        <h2>Personal Details</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Sierra Moser, a Graphic design major with a passion for creation,fashion,and buisness.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have a been working in buisness sence a kid. Helping run my familys farm I have been working in the field for past 20 years. From a young child I have always had an eye for design and love for creativity. I started on my Graphic design  path september 2024. Though I might be late to the grahic design/artist train, it doesn't mean I don't have million doller ideas.Everybody has to jump on the train at some point, and my time is now. For the past five mouths I've been learing how bring to life the thoughts/ideas from my head. In time I'll be up there with the greats, I just have to trust the process.</p>
        
        <h2>Working Style</h2>
        <p>My approach to design is to tap into my inner child, were possibiltys are endless, and imagination it running wild.In my opinion theres no other way to work then to have fun while doing it, lifes to short to not enjoy it. I like finding joy in the small things. While working I like to exoperiment trying to find new innovate creation.</p>
