    <h1>Who is Sierra Moser?</h1>
    <p><strong>My Name:</strong> Sierra Moser</p>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Graphic Design</p>
    
    <h2>Why Whitworth?</h2>
    <p>I chose <em>Whitworth</em> because I got the most scholarship money compared to the other schools that accepted me. Another reason I'm here is because of how <strong>beautiful</strong> the campus is and its proximity to home.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Graphic Design?</h2>
    <p>Honestly, I had <em>no</em> clue what Graphic Design was until I came to Whitworth. The reason I chose this major is because I'm on a mission to turn my dreams into reality, and a Graphic Design major will help me get there. Also, after taking the Adobe Suite class, I just <strong>knew</strong> this was the right path.</p>
    
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>My goal is to work with Nike for about five years, hopefully less. During my time at Nike, I hope to gain more knowledge about my craft as well as dial in on my strengths and weaknesses. After spending some time at Nike, I'll also start my own brand called <strong>EASY STREET</strong>. With my brand, I'll sell clothing designed by me as well as other designers' work. Lastly, when I'm 35, I want to open up <sub>community</sub> centers around America to help kids get the love and support they need.</p>
