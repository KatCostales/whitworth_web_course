<h3>Concerts</h2>
<p>The Red Clay Strays are one of my favorite bands, and I was lucky enough to attend one of their concerts. I did not exactly know who they were before I went to their concert, however they quickly became my favorite. It was amazing and absolutely packed at the event but overall a very cool experience, and the best concert I have been to this year.

<br></br>

Paul Cauthen was another concert I went to this year, and he was definitely an entertainer. His show was super fun and loud, amazingly enough Willow Avalon opened for him, which I knew most of the songs she played, and loved her part of the show.

<br></br>

Colter Wall was the most recent concert I was able to go to this year, it was definitely  the most tame of all the concerts. But still a super fun experience, as he has a beautiful voice.
