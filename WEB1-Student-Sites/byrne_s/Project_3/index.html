            <h2>What is parallax scrolling?</h2>

            <p><b>Parallax is a type of web design that features animations and backgrounds associated with the user
                    scrolling.
                    This can including a background image staying in place, while the content moves around it, or the
                    background
                    itself moves as the user scrolls. It is a play on optical illusions mainly, when the background
                    moves slower
                    than the foreground because it is "farther away".

                    The way each picture slides over the next as you scroll shows a dynamic design style that the user
                    can interact with when scrolling.

                    Parallax is mainly used on the first image when the grass covers up the main illustration. If you
                    look closely you can see the different parts of the image moving up slowly as you scroll, with the
                    grass being the main image that is moving, becuase it is the "closest" one.

                    This is different kind of Parallax design than the previous examples. It showcases new content
                    showing up as the user scrolls, again showing a dynamicism when the user interacts with the website.

                    This is one of my favorite examples of parallax. This features horizontal and vertical scrolling
                    depending on where the user is at on the page. Images slide past as the user moves down, or the user
                    actually moves down on the page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this example, the user seems to be getting closer to the truck as they scroll, with the scrolling
                    also animation the images themselves. All the images in this site are very dynamic, with multiple
                    pieces moving around at once rather than one single image staying in place.
