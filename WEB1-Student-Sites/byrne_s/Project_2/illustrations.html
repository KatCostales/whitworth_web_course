		<p>Completed for a Graphic Design 1 class, this project features my personal 
			interests and design style. In order to successfully complete the project, 
			I delved deeper into the passage that I was hoping to visually interpret. 
			I took imagery from the Bible passage and created an illustration based off 
			it. I decided on complimentary fonts and colors by choosing colors that fit 
			the image I was portraying and then finding complimentary colors off that. 
			Through this project I enhanced my abilities in choosing complimentary colors 
			and fonts as well as my creativity in creating original illustrations. </p>

			<p>This project features a quote from the song "Story" by Kings Kaleidoscope. 
				The goal of the project was to take a quote and make it the main focus of 
				the poster while adding supporting imagery. The style of the typography is 
				meant to embody the brand and feel of the band, person, movie, etc. that 
				the quote originates from. This project stretched my abilities to not only 
				interpret someone else's words, but also my ability to apply certain 
				emotions and "feels" to text and images. In this poster, I hope to give 
				off a hopeful and playful feeling, with the playful, light text style and 
				the inclusion of the rainbow as imagery, which often symbolizes hope. The 
				text and images also are reminiscent of the bands own personal brand featured 
				on past album covers and song art. </p>
