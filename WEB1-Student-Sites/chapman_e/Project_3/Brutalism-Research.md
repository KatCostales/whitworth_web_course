Description

BRUTALISTIC WEB DESIGN IS A HARD TERM TO PIN DOWN PRECISELY, DUE TO THE SIMILARITY IT SHARES AND OVERLAPS WITH STYLES SUCH AS MINIMALISM AND ANTI-DESIGN, AS WELL AS THE COMPLEX HISTORY OF THE STYLE, BUT IN GENERAL IT IS CHARACTERIZED AS AN IMPOSITION OF AN ETHICAL FRAMEWORK HINGING ON TRANSPARENCY, COMBINED WITH EFFICIENCY, UTILITARIANISM, AND SUBVERSIVENESS. THIS OFTEN COMES OUT AS LARGE FONTS, BOLD COLORS, UNORTHODOX NAVIGATION PATTERNS, MINIMAL OR MAXIMAL DESIGN CHOICES, AND GENERAL CLASHING FEATURES THAT OVERALL MAKE UP A THEME TO SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE.
