   3) **“loud colors,”**  
   4) “randomly placed elements that can sometimes even overlap.”  
   5) **Originated as anti-minimalism (in web design); ugly on purpose**  
   6) Large text  
      1) Can even be enough for 1 sentence to require scrolling  
   7) For utilizing brutalism in good design, pair reasonably saturated colors that are still bold, minimal / b/w can work too  
   8) Image format can vary,   
      1) from text color burns,   
      2) to overlap,   
      3) to being b/w,   
      4) to having “be large,”  
      5) “have funny/smooth transitions”  
   9) Text sometimes moving constantly  
   10) **non-ergonomic/non-rational scrolling/transitions (in moderation for good design)**  
   11) Fonts come in a wide range (even custom for the site),   
       1) bigger/wider can work well  
       2) As can display serifs  
       3) And either of those paired with a mono font  
   12) Some websites have a custom cursor  
   13) Misc options  
       1) Cursor only navigation

      2) **“honesty about materials;”**   
      3) **“social vision;”**   
      4) **“and integrity of function.”**
