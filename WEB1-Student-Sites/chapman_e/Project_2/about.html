                        Heya, I’m Eli. Welcome to my portfolio. Not exactly sure what to put here, 
                        since trying to have some broad statement about the cohesion of my art 
                        would not really be my style. Not to say I <i>can’t</i> be pretentious or poetic, 
                        but I like to put forward a pretty casual front unless I have good reason not to. 
                        <br><br>
                        This website functions as a collection of some of my favorite works across all mediums. 
                        I dabble in a lot of stuff, though 2d digital art has become somewhat of a home for me. 
                        For visual art mediums I’ve tried watercolor, gouache, acrylic, graphite, charcoal, 
                        multiple forms of printmaking, and of course digital; 
                        3d I’ve mainly done ceramics and multimedia found-object type pieces. 
                        I also have some of my personal “technical” projects here, some done for school 
                        though all done with my personal goals in mind.
                        <br><br>
                        Generally, the most unifying aspect of the various things I’ve created is their differences. 
                        In pursuing some sort of identity for myself I’ve tried a lot of things. 
                        I’m closer to something of a cohesive human, but I think I’ve also realized 
                        that there is power in not having to know everything, in not having to embody everything. 
                        My struggles with identity and mental health have provided a catalyst for a lot of my work, 
                        though I have also explored things such as my personal perfectionism, societal pressure, 
                        and plenty of such totally self centered things.
                        <br><br>
                        I dunno. I’m still figuring stuff out, but that’s kinda life. 
                        I hope you enjoy looking at what I’ve done so far :)
