	<h2> Who is Prince Paris </h2>
	<p2> I am a sophomore at Whitworth University over in Spokane. I am majoring in Graphic Design currently and am inspiring to be an illustrator. I would also like to sell prints or anything of the sort of my art. In my classes I have created a book cover of the <em> Lord of the Flies</em> and a blind box with characters from the video game <em> Dead by Daylight</em>. In high school I created a small illustration for a wine bottle. </p2>
