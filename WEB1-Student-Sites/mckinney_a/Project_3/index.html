    <h2>What is Retro?</h2>
    <p1>Retro web design revives past trends to add liveliness and flair to a site. There are many different Retro Web Styles including, 

Art deco style which is art from the 1920s, as well there is 
Vibrant retro designs; flashy design from the 1990s. 
Retrofuturism which is designs of the future as imagined by the 1950s.
Maximalism (where more is more)
â€™70s revival (with funky shapes and warm color schemes) and
Art Nouveau 
Most Retro websites feature a 
Throwback design set to a specific decade: A site often emulates a particular decade or moment in design, not several. 
Shapes, lines, and textures: Designers often use elements that were prominent in a certain decade to create a more suggestive retro feel.
Previously trending fonts: Using fonts that were trendy in past decades is an easy way to add a retro feel to a site without changing much else. 
Functionality; Retro websites imitate older design styles but prioritize modern navigation and functionalities. <br> <br> </p1>
