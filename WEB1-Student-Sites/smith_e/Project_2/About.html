<p class="big"> As an art creator and designer, I want to inspire others to explore their inner creative selves. My own art, therefore, is intended to model creative expression through the use of different mediums and muses to capture the beautiful world we live in.
  My creative process thrives on enjoyment which leads me toward abstraction and handcrafted aesthetics. I am driven by bright colors, textures, and dynamic shapes within my design style. I also enjoy crafting handwritten fonts because it allows me to be more expressive and flexible with what I create. I take inspiration from bold graphic aesthetics of the American Kitsch and the raw abstraction of Grunge design are what inspire me. I gravitate towards an earthy palette but I love to add vivid colors to create a captivating visual contrast.
  Nature serves as a big muse in my paintings and artworks. I like to capture the essence of a subject - whether human or animal - in realistic detail, juxtaposed against abstract backgrounds with playful strokes and bright colors. I enjoy contemporary trends, combining surrealist elements to add a sense of playful interest into my work.
  I use a variety of mediums, ranging from acrylics and watercolors to pen and ink, as well as digital tools like Procreate. I explore mediums that align with my mood and artistic vision which allows me to explore with style and expression.
Just as how listening to music can prompt people to make music themselves, I believe that creating visual art can inspire others to create as well.</p>
