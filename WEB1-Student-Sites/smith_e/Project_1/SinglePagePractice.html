<h2 style="text-align:center;color:Tomato;background-color:white"> Fungi Kindgom</h2>

<p style="color:Maroon;">Mushrooms belong in the fungi kingdom, which has over 144,000 known species. <br>Mushrooms are usually found near other plants and use plants as a stable place to grow, however mushrooms are not plants themselves.

<i><br><blockquote><p style="color:Maroon;">Some mushrooms are safe to eat, while others pose a risk of harm if consumed or even touched. </blockquote> </i> </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;color:Tomato;background-color:white"> Benefits of Mushrooms</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><b>Antioxidants</b></dt>
  <dd> Two powerful antioxidants, selenium and ergothioneine, are found in mushrooms and impart anti-inflammatory benefits when consumed.</dd>
  <dt><b>B Vitamins</b></dt>
  <dd>Often under-consumed, B vitamins are responsible for a variety of tasks in the body. They reduce inflammation, promote heart health, and fortify the body’s immune response. Mushrooms contain significant amounts of B vitamins, including riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and niacin.</dd>
	<dt><b>Potassium</b></dt>
    <dd>Potassium is involved with many processes within the body, including nerve signals, muscular contractions, and internal fluid balance. A medium-sized banana can be replaced with two-thirds of a cup of mushrooms for the same potassium boost without the additional sugar.
    <dt><b>Vitamin D</b></dt>
    <dd>Typically acquired via the skin’s exposure to sunlight, vitamin D is rarely found in foods but is an absolute necessity for your bones. Foods containing vitamin D, such as fish or dairy products, may be restricted for those on a special diet. Mushrooms’ significant vitamin D content augments your intake of vitamin D from the sun (without the need to wear SPF).
