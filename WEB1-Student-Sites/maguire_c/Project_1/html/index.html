        <p>Once, there was peace. Long ago, there was a time when the people of the galaxy were able to enjoy their days in prosperity, without the worry of their lives being torn asunder. Then, for the first time in nearly one thousand years, this peace was threatened by the Echo of Conquest, as most would come to call it. This was a cold war between two sub factions that spread out across multiple systems throughout galactic space. Spies were punished harshly, but no inherent acts of war were initiated. For a time, the innocents could rest easy knowing that they were safe. That is, until the Great Ignition began the Age of Blood and Flame.

            In CY 562, a skirmish began in the political capital of the galaxy, Krowl, and roared across settled space. Even up until this very day, nobody can quite recall what caused the violent chain of events that quickly led to friends turning into foe, homes into ash, and, eventually, a planet into little more than craters and shattered dreams. It was at this point that the very concept of prolonged peace was eradicated.

            Now, more than one hundred years later in CY 680, the galaxy is embroiled in various proxy wars and bloody conflicts that it cannot hope to rid itself of. Very few know the reason for the Great Ignition, even less care to find out, and even fewer have been able to achieve what resembles a life from before the Age of Blood and Flame. Soldiers are comparable to pirates. The line between good and evil is blurred.

            For within a galaxy of blood and flame, peace is but a legend.</p>
