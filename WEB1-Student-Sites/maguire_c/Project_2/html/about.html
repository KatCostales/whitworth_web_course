            <p class="nameText">Work Statement</p>
            <p class="otherText">Since I was young, I have loved seeing how shows, movies, and comics portray both magically fantastical and scientifically advanced characters. This love and passion has since evolved into a desire to illustrate both characters from pre-established franchises and characters from my own mind, and this is where one of my two art worlds focuses. When I sit down to create people or creatures, I find immense joy in making sketches of them and adding to the piece, taking inspiration and small references from other artists, tweaking what I come up with until I have something uniquely my own. One such creation is a character I play in Dungeons and Dragons that has evolved, both in story and in appearance, in the past three to four years. While it can certainly be frustrating at times, ending up with a cool character whose design itself can infer a story is very satisfying. Not only do I have something that I can call my own at the end of the day, it is also inspiring to hear the reactions people have to my pieces and what comments they have to make on it. Were my messages communicated as I wanted? Did they notice the small details I took so long to design and incorporate?
                As somebody who is also enthusiastic about and educated in technology, I also strive to create thoughtful and intuitive user interfaces (UI) that provide users a good experience when using programs on their computers, phones, and other devices. Whether it be creating easily navigable websites, designing menus and inventory screens for video games, or otherwise constructing digital elements and pages and stories with which people can interact, I aim to mix my passions for technology and art. Looking beyond the technical skill employed, user interface and user experience is an intriguing way to engage and influence people who interact with my work for the better.
                At some point in the future, I hope I can create works that will stick with viewers. I hope to eventually produce projects that will leave people feeling engaged and inspired to go out and create for themselves. Regardless of what scope these projects may turn out to cover, I want to make something that resonates with and leaves a positive impression on whoever happens to stumble upon it. Though, it definitely would not hurt to get famous and mega rich from it.</p>
