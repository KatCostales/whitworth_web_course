            <h2>The best way to describe the Y2K design style...</h2>
            <p> ...in web desgin is a style of design used in the late 90s and early 2000s using crazy colors such as
                neons and metallic tones, super stylized fonts, and was built upon that retro-futuristic vision of the internet. Additionally,
                when I think of Y2K, I think of all those old gaming website with line/metal
                textures on elements and lots of boxes and tightly packed information. In my opinion, the pinnacle of Y2K design can be thought of as gamer guys
                slapping stuff on a web page to try an look as cool as possible. There is also a bit of jank to it in the sense that it seems like the creator knew how 
                to design a website, but they obviously didn't have the experience or the fancy tools we have today. An old school charm if you will.

            <h2>Examples of websites using this style:</h2>
            <p>As it is a little difficult to find some Y2K designs in 2025, the links will direct to Web Design Museum, a website that display certain websites as they were way back when. </br>
                Each of these websites portrays aspects that could be described as "Y2K". The two most similar here are the Xbox and Nintendo website pages which both contain lots of different
                elements like text boxes and images -- a content dense space. Then there is the Playstation website which took a much more nebulus approach as opposed to structured boxes. However, it still adheres to
                the color range, the density of words and images, etc. Finally, we have Newgrounds and Webagent 007 which are more of the same. While these diverge in their own direction in terms of a more singular color pallette
                (almost entirely red for Webagent 007 and grey with some yellow for Newgrounds) the other aspects are par for the course.
